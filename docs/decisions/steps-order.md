## Steps order change

I decided to change the order of the steps. The step 4 is done before step 3. I did it in this way because I felt that it was easier to add the region in the original structure than do it in the structure that you get after you group by state.
Anyway, it wouldn't be so difficult to do it in the proposed order.
